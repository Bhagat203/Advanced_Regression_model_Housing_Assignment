# Advanced Linear Regression Assignment for Housing Data for Australia
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 


## Table of Contents
* The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using          regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:

> Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

> How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- Performing the EDA
-Identify significant variables
-Model accuracy test
-Regularization parameter optimization

## Conclusions
- We were able to efficiently and accurately check if the data is clean and clean the data if required.
- Predict the important or significant variables that defines the property purchases
- Model is built on a great accuracy with tested data efficiency
